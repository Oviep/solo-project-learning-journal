                Hi there! My name is Ovie and welcome to my learning journal.
            </h1>

            <p class="hero-text">After several months of learning in the Front-End Developer Career
                 Path, I've made the big jump to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my 
                Solo projects and meet like minded peers 
            </p>

             <p class="article-header">How I stay commited to learning</p>
             <p class="article-text">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used two 
                 spend hours and hours learning, then try and create simple projects 
                 using what I learned or work on new techniques into existing projects. <br>
                 <span class="line-break">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was 
                 learning and most things about my journey with the world.</span> 
             </p>

             <p class="article-header">How I got started</p>
            <p class="article-text">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
                  learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but
                    also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words. <br>

                 <span class="line-break">That helped me grow what I was learning and I realised that posting my learning summaries was also 
                    helping others learn and stay motivated.
            </p></span>
